<h2> CSS frameworks </h2>
<body>
    Starting your coding projects from scratch can sometimes be a hassle. Especially when doing the project for someone other than yourself which would put you on a time-crunch. This is where CSS frameworks can come in handy. CSS frameworks are meant to help give you a boost on your project and build a framework that can save you a lot of time. Some of the more popular frameworks that I learned about this week are Bootstrap, Tailwind, Foundation, Material, Bulma and Skeleton. These are very different from each other and have different functions based on what you need/want with your project. Although these frameworks can save you a lot of time and energy, they also have some downsides that come with them. Such as, bulky file sizes, making your website more generic, and less customization opportunities. 
	Bootstrap is the first framework that I explored on this list and seems to be one of the more powerful frameworks you can use. It lets you build and customize your site using Sass and JavaScript. Once you start using the bootstrap framework you implement Sass but only using the components you need. It also allows you to utilize CSS using their variables, maps, functions, and mixins. A few other positives to bootstrap include being able to use their utility API, being able to use JavaScript plugins with jQuery, custom bootstrap icons, and custom bootstrap themes. 
	Tailwindcss is another extremely powerful framework that I learned about this week. Tailwindcss really makes front-end developing much easier and can reduce the amount of code you use. People have described it as “low-level” and very easy to use once you get used to it. It can allow you to create a complex website the fastest out of the other frameworks I learned about and can easily make it so each website looks very different. A big benefit to tailwindcss is that it automatically removes un-necessary CSS that is in your code which makes it so the script is as short as it can be. This makes it easier to read and easier to fix if necessary. Some of the other benefits with tailwindcss are how responsive it can be regarding utility classes, the easy-to-implement hover function, its ability to take out repetitive utility patterns, the tailwind UI, and “world-class IDE integration”. 
	Overall, this week I learned about a ton of useful frameworks but tailwindcss and bootstrap were my favorites and the ones I could see myself using in the future! It was very cool to learn about them all though.
